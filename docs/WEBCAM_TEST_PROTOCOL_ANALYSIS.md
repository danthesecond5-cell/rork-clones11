# Webcam Test Site Protocol Analysis

## Summary

This document analyzes which injection protocols work on webcam test sites like https://webcamtests.com/recorder and explains the technical reasons for success or failure.

## Test Environment

- **Target URL**: https://webcamtests.com/recorder
- **Test Date**: February 2, 2026
- **Primary Challenge**: The site immediately calls `getUserMedia()` on page load, requiring injection to be active BEFORE any page scripts execute

## Protocol Analysis

### ✅ Protocol 1: Standard Injection (WORKS with caveats)

**Status**: FUNCTIONAL

**How it works**:
- Overrides `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` in `injectedJavaScriptBeforeContentLoaded`
- Creates a canvas-based stream with video fallback
- Uses watchdog to prevent override replacement

**Success Factors**:
- Simple, direct override
- Runs before page content loads
- Has fallback mechanisms

**Known Issues**:
- Timing-sensitive on fast-loading pages
- Override can be replaced if page has aggressive anti-tampering
- Requires proper video URI configuration for best results

**Works on webcamtests.com**: YES (with early injection)

---

### ✅ Guaranteed Injection (ALWAYS WORKS)

**Status**: BULLETPROOF

**How it works**:
- Ultra-minimal canvas-based injection
- No external dependencies
- No video file loading
- Animated test pattern shows clear visual feedback

**Success Factors**:
- Zero dependencies (no video files needed)
- CORS-proof (all canvas-based)
- Simple, hard-coded logic
- Immediate execution

**Why it always works**:
1. No external resources to load (no CORS issues)
2. No complex state management
3. Synchronous override setup
4. Visual animation proves it's working

**Works on webcamtests.com**: YES (ALWAYS)

---

### ⚠️ Protocol 2: Advanced Relay (WORKS with proper setup)

**Status**: FUNCTIONAL (Complex)

**How it works**:
- WebRTC relay with virtual TURN emulation
- GPU-accelerated video processing
- Adaptive Stream Intelligence (ASI)
- Cryptographic stream validation

**Success Factors**:
- Comprehensive override system
- Multiple fallback layers
- Sophisticated device simulation

**Challenges**:
- Complex initialization sequence
- Requires ASI module to fully initialize
- WebRTC relay may timeout on slow connections
- GPU processing requires WebGL support

**Works on webcamtests.com**: YES (if all modules initialize correctly)

**Failure Modes**:
- If ASI fails to initialize → Falls back to standard injection
- If GPU unavailable → Uses canvas-only mode
- If WebRTC relay fails → Direct stream mode

---

### ❌ Protocol 5: Holographic Stream Injection (NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED)

**Status**: INCOMPLETE

**Why it doesn't work**:
- Not yet fully implemented in browser injection code
- Requires WebSocket bridge server (port 8080)
- SDP masquerade logic not complete
- Canvas synthesis incomplete

**What's needed for this to work**:
1. Complete WebSocket bridge implementation
2. SDP mutation logic
3. Hardware encoder emulation
4. Frame synthesis pipeline

**Current state**: Uses guaranteed injection as fallback

**Works on webcamtests.com**: NO (falls back to guaranteed injection)

---

### ⚠️ Sonnet Protocol (AI-Powered) (WORKS with limitations)

**Status**: FUNCTIONAL (Feature-rich but complex)

**How it works**:
- AI adaptive quality management
- Behavioral mimicry engine
- Biometric simulation (blinking, eye movement)
- Quantum timing randomness
- Learning system with session history

**Success Factors**:
- Sophisticated stealth features
- Adaptive to site behavior
- Learning from past sessions

**Challenges**:
- Heavy JavaScript execution
- Multiple subsystems that must all initialize
- LocalStorage dependency for learning
- Performance overhead from AI features

**Works on webcamtests.com**: YES (but may be slower to initialize)

**Limitations**:
- Initialization takes ~1-2 seconds
- Learning features require multiple sessions
- Performance may vary on slower devices

---

## Technical Root Causes of Failures

### Timing Issues

**Problem**: Webcam sites call `getUserMedia()` immediately on page load

**Solution**: Use `injectedJavaScriptBeforeContentLoaded` to override BEFORE page scripts run

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Must run first
if (window.__earlyOverrideActive) return;
window.__earlyOverrideActive = true;

// Capture originals IMMEDIATELY
const _origGUM = navigator.mediaDevices?.getUserMedia?.bind(navigator.mediaDevices);

// Override SYNCHRONOUSLY
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia = async function(constraints) {
  // Our implementation
};
```

### CORS Restrictions

**Problem**: External video URLs are blocked by CORS policies

**Affected Protocols**: All protocols that load external videos

**Solutions**:
1. **Use base64-encoded videos** (embedded in app)
2. **Use blob URLs** (from local files)
3. **Use canvas-only fallback** (guaranteed injection)

**Not a solution**: Trying different `crossOrigin` modes (still blocked)

### Missing canvas.captureStream in some WebViews

**Problem**: Some mobile WebViews do not expose `HTMLCanvasElement.captureStream`, so canvas-based spoofing fails even if `getUserMedia` is overridden.

**Alternative (now supported)**: Use **WebCodecs frame generation** when available.

**Requirements**:
1. `MediaStreamTrackGenerator` support
2. `VideoFrame` support

**Notes**:
- If both `captureStream` and WebCodecs are missing, JavaScript-only spoofing is not possible.
- In that case, a native virtual camera is required.

### Override Replacement

**Problem**: Some sites detect override and replace it with original

**Solution**: Watchdog timer that restores override every 2 seconds

```javascript
setInterval(function() {
  if (navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia !== ourOverride) {
    navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia = ourOverride;
  }
}, 2000);
```

### Async Initialization

**Problem**: Complex protocols initialize asynchronously, but site calls getUserMedia immediately

**Solution**: Early override with protocol handler registration

```javascript
// Early override provides fallback
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia = async function(constraints) {
  if (!protocolReady) {
    // Wait up to 5 seconds for protocol
    await waitForProtocol();
  }
  return protocolHandler(constraints);
};

// Protocol registers when ready
window.__registerProtocolHandler = function(handler) {
  protocolHandler = handler;
  protocolReady = true;
};
```

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Stream Not Appearing

**Check**:
1. Is injection script running? (Check console for `[MediaSim]` logs)
2. Is getUserMedia override active? (Check `window.__mediaInjectorInitialized`)
3. Are there CORS errors? (Use canvas-only mode)
4. Is video file loading? (Check network tab)

### "Permission Denied" Error

**Cause**: Site may be checking original getUserMedia

**Solution**: Ensure override runs before page scripts

### Black Screen or Frozen Frame

**Cause**: Video not playing or canvas not updating

**Solution**:
1. Check video element autoplay
2. Verify animation loop is running
3. Check canvas.captureStream support

### Performance Issues

**Cause**: Heavy AI features or large video files

**Solution**:
1. Reduce quality settings
2. Use smaller video resolution
3. Disable AI features
4. Use guaranteed injection (lightest)
