The repository now has:
- Clean git history with all merges documented
- All duplicate branches removed
- All merged PR branches deleted
- Single source of truth on `main` branch

## Manual Steps Required

**Important:** To complete the consolidation:

1. **Change Default Branch:**
   - Go to Repository Settings > Branches
   - Change default branch from `cursor/kyc2` to `main`

2. **Delete cursor/kyc2:**
   After changing the default branch, run:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete cursor/kyc2
   ```

3. **Close Remaining Open PRs:**
   If needed, manually close PRs #23, #31, #57, #58, #59 (their work is already in main)

## Verification

```bash
# View all branches (should only show main)
git branch -a

# View recent consolidated commits
git log --oneline -20

# Verify no pending merges

```
