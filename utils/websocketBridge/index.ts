/**
 * WebSocket Video Bridge
 * 
 * Protocol 6: Local WebSocket Relay
 * 
 * This module provides a WebSocket-based video streaming bridge between
 * the React Native app and the WebView. Instead of relying on canvas-based
 * injection which can have timing issues, this approach:
 * 
 * 1. Captures video frames in React Native
 * 2. Sends them via WebSocket to the WebView
 * 3. The WebView reconstructs the frames into a MediaStream
 * 
 * This bypasses all canvas/captureStream timing issues and gives
 * complete control over the video feed.
 * 
 * EXPO GO COMPATIBILITY:
 * ----------------------
 * This module is FULLY COMPATIBLE with Expo Go because:
 * - WebSocket APIs are available in React Native without native modules
 * - The injection script runs in the WebView's JavaScript environment
 * - No custom native code is required
 * 
 * The WebSocketVideoBridge uses standard React Native WebSocket support
 * which works in both Expo Go and development builds.
